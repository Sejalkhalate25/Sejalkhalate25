SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

•	COUNT():The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.

Syntax:

SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

•	AVG():The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.

Syntax:

SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


•	SUM():The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

Syntax:

SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

•	ORDERBY(): The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;






What is operators?
An operator is a reserved word or a character used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations. These Operators are
 
used to specify conditions in an SQL statement and to serve as conjunctions for multiple conditions in a statement.

The Operators are: AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN, LESS THAN,GREATER THAN.

•	AND: The WHERE clause can be combined with AND operators. The AND operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition. The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

•	OR: The WHERE clause can be combined with OR operators. The OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition: The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

•	NOT:The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;


•	BETWEEN: The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.

Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

•	LESS THAN: Less than operator is used to find out less value from table. We can used WHERE clause.

Syntax:
 
SELECT * from table_name WHERE condition;

•	GREATER THAN: Greater than operator is used to find out greater value from table. We can used WHERE clause.

Syntax:
SELECT * from table_name WHERE condition;

Conclusion: We have studied SQL DML commands and SQL Functions and Operators and perform all the queries on database table.
