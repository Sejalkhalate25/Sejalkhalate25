Querying Aggregate Functions(COUNT,SUM,AVG,MAX and MIN)

Aim: To Practice Queries using Aggregate functions for the following

1.	Write a Query to display the information present in the passenger and cancellation tables
2.	Display the number of days in a week on which the AP123 bus is available
3.	Find number of tickets booked for each PNR_No using GROUP BY CLAUSE
4.	Find the distinct PNR Numbers that are present.


1.	Write a Query to display the information present in the passenger and cancellation tables


MYSQL> CREATE TABLE CANCELLATION2(PNRNO INT PRIMARY KEY,JOURNEYDATE DATETIME, NOOFSEATS INT,ADDRESS VARCHAR(20),CONTACTNO INT,STATUS VARCHAR(10),FOREIGN KEY(PNRNO) REFERENCES RESERVATION2(PNRNO));


mysql> INSERT INTO CANCELLATION2 VALUES(10201,'2012-02-20 10:20:25',2,'HYD',9654235242,'CONFIRM');


mysql> INSERT INTO CANCELLATION2 VALUES(10202,'2012-02-22 10:22:25',2,'HYD',9654232451,'CONFIRM');


mysql> INSERT INTO CANCELLATION2 VALUES(10203,'2012-03-22 10:30:25',2,'DELHI',9654587960,'CONFIRM');
 
MySQL> SELECT * FROM RESERVATION UNION SELECT * FROM CANCELLATION;



2.	Display the Minimum age of the Passenger

MySQL> SELECT MIN(AGE) as MINAGE FROM PASSENGER;

 
3.	Find number of tickets booked for each PNR_No using GROUP BY CLAUSE

MySQL> SELECT PNRNO,SUM(No_of_SEATS) AS SUM_OF_SEATS FROM RESERVATION2	GROUP BY PNRNO;



4	Find the distinct PNR Numbers that are present.

MySQL> SELECT DISTINCT PNR_NO FROM RESERVATION2;

 
5	Mysql> select sum(Noofseats) from Cancellation2;



6	Find the total number of cancelled seats.

MySQL> select sum(noofseats) as canceled_seats from cancellation2;

 






Creation and Droping of Views

mysql> create table students(sid int primary key,name varchar(15),login varchar(15), age int,gpa real); mysql> create table Enrolled(sid int,cid int,grade varchar(5),primary key(sid,cid), foreign key(sid) references students(sid));


mysql>create view BStudents(name,sid,course) AS SELECT s.name,s.sid,E.cid from students s,enrolled E where s.sid=e.sid AND E.grade='B';
 


Syntax: Drop view viewname;

Mysql> Drop view Bstudents; Mysql> Drop view Goodstudents;
